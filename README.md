# Tacotron-2-Audio-Preprocessor
This Python script preprocesses audio files for training a Tacotron 2 text-to-speech model. It trims silence, normalizes the audio, and saves the processed files to a specified output folder. It's specifically designed to work with .wav files to help create a clean and consistent dataset for Tacotron 2 model training.
